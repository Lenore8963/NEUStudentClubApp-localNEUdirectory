# NEUStudentClubApp-local

This is a simple Node.js web application which runs locally and on Azure. It signs in users with Microsoft Entra.

However, the cloud version is not working correctly, after logging in, it goes back to the sign in with Microsoft page, not displaying any user profile.

It has the same structure with: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/external-id/customers/sample-web-app-node-sign-in

I followed the instructions here: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/quickstart-nodejs?tabs=windows&pivots=development-environment-azure-portal
